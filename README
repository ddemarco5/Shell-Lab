Dominic DeMarco Shell Project.

Code Status:
-Complete and funtional to specifications.
-Runs on Linux only.
-All features are implemented that were requested on the lab's web page.

Notable Bugs:
-When attempting to cd to a directory above / a segfault occurs.
-Sometimes when a job is stored, the name is wingdingy gibberish.
-Every so often when resuming from a program that takes over the screen,
 the prompt appears before the output.
-Possibly other slight ones, as I am not a C error checking pro, but those
 are the major ones I've come across in my limited testing.

NOTE WHEN COMPILING

DOES NOT COMPILE ON POLARIS, a bug in the linux distrobution running on polaris
exists where there is a syntax error in the file 
"/usr/include/bits/resource.h:171: error: comma at end of enumerator list"

WHEN COMPILING ON ITL MACHINES

The ITL machines have a linux distrobution that does not have the dev package
of readline installed, so as a result I have compiled readline locally and 
have pointed to those local libraries in the makefile

Long story short, run make on the ITL computers and it will compile.
